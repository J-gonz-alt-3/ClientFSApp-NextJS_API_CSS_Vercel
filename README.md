# Project Outline

This will be a Full Stack NextJS Web Application!

This project WILL take some time, it is still NOT complete.

Regardless, I've progressed enough to at least show where I currently am, but I want to stress that at the moment I'm only maybe 45% done with this project.

Project Link: https://client-fs-app-next-js-api-css-vercel-i9-git-0c3d2c-j-gonz-alt-3.vercel.app

# Tools Used

- NextJS (Framework for Production)
- JavaScript (Frontend/Backend language)
- API Routing in NextJS (API endpoint created by NextJS - grabs user data and stores in database - data.json)
- BootStrap and SASS/CSS (Styling)
- MongoDB (DataBase)
- Vercel (Deployment)

# Thoughts so Far

As of writing this, all pages on this WebApplication have been coded to be fully Responsive across all devices.

I would say about 50% of the data is currently on the site, however that task is still in progress.

As far as the color scheme of the site as a whole, that is still pending and open for change depending on my and the client's perspective as we inch closer to project completion. (Not too worried about this tbh).

# Current Project Task

The current task I am working on is implementing MongoDB into the project.

Will continue to work on this when I have down time!
